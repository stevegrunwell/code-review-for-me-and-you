**Not so great:**

> If I were you, I'd move this function into the `Widget` class so it's not so hard to find.

**Better:** <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

> It seems like this function is closely related to the `Widget` class and not used anywhere else — would it make sense to move it into the class, instead?

<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0" -->

Note:

* Instead of telling taking a "I know better than you" standpoint, make a statement and ask a leading question.
